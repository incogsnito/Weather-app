<h1>Weather App</h1>
<p>This is a simple weather app I made to learn how to manipulate apis. The app doesn't do much for nowm, but it should run fine and you can dynamically change your location. There will be more changes to come to the project as I learn more and look for things that I can add and code that I can clear</p>

<h2>  How It's Made: </h2>

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, OpenWeather API

This was a challenging one for me. I went through a lot of overthinking before opening my IDE. I absolutely flowed creating this when I passed that phase. I had alot of fun with this project, more fun than I normally do. I strengthened my debugging skills and I feel a whole lot more confident getiing outside of my comfort zone.



<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>
<p>I learnt a lot.<br>
First of course I learnt how to manipulate API's and what API's are. <br>
I learnt how to use the Fetch API. <br>
I finally have a better understanding of how arrays work.<br>
I'm getting better at breaking down problems so I can better implement coding solutions.</p>


<h3>PS</h3>
<p>This project is still open so there will be a lot of changes and improvements over time.</p>
